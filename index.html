The report defines it very narrowly, encompassing mainly denominations in the United States and the United Kingdom, which can trace their history back to nonconforming Protestants, Puritans, Separatists, Independents, English religious groups coming out of the English Civil War, and other English Dissenters not satisfied with the degree to which the Church of England had been reformed.</p>

              Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices.
              Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen coud be provided with a School Canteen Account on the schoo website that keeps track of their previous meal choices 
              and any dietary requiremets they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less

          <p class="list-group-item text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1. Accuracy
           Humans are porne to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated atendance management systems ensure accurrate time records and 
           minimize the inevitable and costly errors with annual data entry. This accurate dad helps to provide accurate performance ad payroll data.
           <br>
           2. Economics
           Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by the Axsium Group found that large organizations save up to $1,000 per employee after Implementing automated attendance management systems.
           <br>
           3. Productiviy/ Efficiency
           Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time-consuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased productivity and improves profits.
